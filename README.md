# MOVIEBOX

## Description

An app that allows the user to see reviews, trailers, ratings & related media of movies from the past, present and future.

## User Story

As a moviegoer, I want to know what good movies to see. I want to see trailers, reviews & recommendations so I know what to expect and will enjoy the movie I chose to watch.

### Functionality

The page pulls current popular movies from The Movie Database and displays them with their current overall rating.

The top of the page has a slideshow banner to grab the eye as well as a search bar so the user can find specific movies.

When the user scrolls down, there are different movie genres displayed.

When the genres are clicked the movies displayed will be filtered by that genre.

When the user mouses over a movie, they are presented with a brief synopsis as well as a button to view the trailer and related media on YouTube.

### Development Process

We divided the development process by giving each group member a specific task, though of course our work overlapped in areas.

Neale focused on HTML, Lord on CSS, Triet on JavaScript & Michael on organization, readme, slideshow, speaker notes, etc.

We all had an input when it came to the user interface and functionality of the project.

### Installation & Usage Instructions

No installation required.

Use the genre buttons to filter the films shown.

Hover over a film to display a synopsis.

Click on the button to display a trailer and related media.

Use the search bar to find specific films.

### Technologies Used

APIs: The Movie Database (TMDb), Youtube
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Challenges Encountered

Some APIs did not operate how we initially thought they would or could not provide the functionality we wanted, so we had to change them.

### Directions for Future Development

Future development would involve more compatible and up to date APIs, more interactivity for the user as well as maybe even our own APIs to avoid
reliance on third parties.

Fix buttons at the top of the page and in the carousel that are not currently working.
